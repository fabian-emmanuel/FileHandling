# FileHandling

Introduction to file handling - parsing and reading from config files
/* @author : Fabian Emmanuel */

#

In an application, different configuration files could be used depending on the level of development. 
This project would primarily test your knowledge of file handling, string manipulation and basic programming construct in Java.
You are to create a Java application that would parse and read values from config files. 
The data in configuration file should be accessed with the following syntax.
ConfigParser config = new ConfigParser(“name_of_file”);
Once your applications start, the config file(s) should be read and values based on the environment(production, development, staging)
should be stored in a Map.
Command Line arguments should be used to specify the environment in which the code would be executed in. Below is an illustration

Production java Main.java
Staging java Main.java staging
Development java Main.java development

The environment should specify the file to read from.
For example if the environment passed to it is “production” the the file to read would be filename + environment;
There should be a default name if a name of the file is not passed to the constructor.

Here is a format of an example config file:

dbname=sq04_db
host=127.0.0.1
port=8080

[application]
name=fintek
port=8081
context-url=/api/v1
mode=dev
theme=yellow
pipeline=fast

[application]
name=fintrack

For each of this values i should be able to use the values by calling the get methods and passing the keys e.g
String dbName = config.get(‘dbname’);
String stagingDbname = config.get(‘application.name’);

Where there are multiple values for a key, the first one that appears in the config file should be used. For example
· If the get method for the key ‘application.name’ is called, based on the example file provided above, it should return the value fintek.
· If the get method for the key ‘dbname’ is called, it should return ‘sq04_db’.
All values should be returned as a string.
